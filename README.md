PlayPal

PlayPal is an app designed to allow gamers to connect with other gamers around the world who are interested in playing the same multiplayer games, but cannot find people to play with. 

The app is designed as a safer and more reliable way for gamers to find and connect with one another.

The app will feature an account creation option which will send confirmation emails after an account is created. Players will also be able to create postings where they look for a certain number of other gamers for a specific game.
